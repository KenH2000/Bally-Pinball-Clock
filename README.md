* RTC module (clock keeps time when not powered on)
* Nixie Tube power supply (optional, supports original plasma displays)
* Small stripboard
* 20 pin .156 female J1 connector and female pins
* 7805 Voltage regulator
* 2 momentary push buttons
* 2 LEDs
* 2 220 Ohm resistors
* 1 10k Ohm resistor
* 2 10 uF capacitors
* 2 22 pF capacitors
* 16 MHz clock crystal
* DC power jack
* 12V/1A plug-in power supply
* misc electronics -- wire/headers/solder
